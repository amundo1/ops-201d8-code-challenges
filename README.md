# Code Fellows CyberOps code Challenge


### Hello and welcome to my CyberOps code challenge repo!

In this repo I am publishing scripts and snippets of code that explore and demonstrate administrative and configuration automation techniques. I have embarked on the journey to become a Cybersecurity Professional through the Cybersecurity Engineering Bootcamp at Code Fellows. I am learning the skills that are proving to be practical and relevant to establishing the building blocks of a well rounded Cybersecurity professional. 

Ops 102 and Ops 201 have established the fundamentals of computer hardware, computer operations and basic coding. The idea that "Data is Sacred" has set the foundation for understanding the importance of backing up data, data recovery and system restore principles. Through the implementation of hypervisor technology, VirtualBox has been instrumental in providing both an opportunity to practice system configuration fundamentals and a sandbox for troubleshooting systems through scenario based training. 

ops201d8_10.ps1 and ops201d8_11.ps1 are my favorite challenges. They provided the opportunity to write basic Powershell scripts exploring the automation of checking, starting and stopping processes, and making changes to the firewall, network configuration and registry. These scripts are examples of how they can be used in the workplace to make consistent changes across multiple systems. I would like to improve both of these scripts and I would like to reproduce them in bash for a Linux machine. My goal is to improve my scripting through optimizing my code and ensuring my comments are clear. I want make sure my code is clean and clear to its purpose. Ultimately I hope to achieve the skillset to write code that is portable, reusable, supportable and scalable.
